    label: "Nutrient uptake"
    actions:
      - "Glucose absorption peaks; insulin guides nutrients into muscle and liver glycogen."
      - "Blood glucose is still rising; insulin helps store glucose as glycogen."
      - "Nutrient absorption and insulin activity remain elevated."

      - "The gut starts its cleaning waves (migrating motor complex) as insulin drops."
      - "Post-absorptive phase; the gut begins cleaning cycles between meals."
      - "Post-absorptive phase; the gut’s cleaning cycles can resume."
      - "Post-absorptive phase; migrating motor complex activity may start."
